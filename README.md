# RL_TSP_4static
## This is a rough version. More details would be added.

+ Trained model is available in the tsp_transfer_... dirs.
+ To test the model, use the load_all_rewards in Post_process dir.
+ To train the model, run train_motsp_transfer.py
+ To visualize the obtained Pareto Front, the result should be visulaized using Matlab.
+ Matlab code would be public soon.
